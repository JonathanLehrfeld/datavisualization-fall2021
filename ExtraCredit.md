Here is a link to the initial article I read in the Washington Post about supply chain problems causing a shortage of Christmas tree supply [LINK HERE](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/11/26/christmas-tree-shortage). The article was published last Friday, and seemed like a the perfect example of a story that could have benefited from including a data visualization.

The article references data the American Christmas Tree Association uses, which itself got its data from a report this past July from the US Department of Agriculture which I have [LINKED HERE](https://www.nass.usda.gov/Statistics_by_State/Washington/Publications/Current_News_Release/2021/xmas2020.pdf). The data I have chosen to visualize is from the last figure of the press release (on Page 3).

Since the data was presented as a pdf I converted it first to Excel and then copied the data into Datawrapper to create the graphic. I chose the various green colors to resemble the color of Christmas trees. I also chose a different shade of green specifically for the overall number of trees to highlight the significance of that while some varities of trees may have had more or less planted in 2021 than in 2020, overall the total number of trees planted went down.

And [HERE](https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/7Fgav/2/) is the link to the final graphic I created.

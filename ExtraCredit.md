Here is a link to the initial article I read in the Washington Post about supply chain problems causing a shortage of Christmas tree supply [LINK HERE](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/11/26/christmas-tree-shortage). The article was published last Friday, and seemed like a the perfect example of a story that could have benefited from including a data visualization.
The article references data the American Christmas Tree Association uses, which itself got its data from a report this past July from the US Department of Agriculture which I have [LINKED HERE](https://www.nass.usda.gov/Statistics_by_State/Washington/Publications/Current_News_Release/2021/xmas2020.pdf). The data I have chosen to visualize data from the last figure of the press release (on Page 3).

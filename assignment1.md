# Jonathan Lehrfeld Final Class Project Pitch

## Question to answer:

### Which Washington, D.C. ward has the highest cost of living?

## Data that might be available (to answer my question):

### 
* Information on average apartment rent / housing cost / additional housing fees in each neighborhood.
* Information on average utilities cost in each neighborhood.
* Information on average internet cost in each neighborhood.
* Information on average cost of supermarket trip / frequency of supermarket trips in each neighborhood.
* Information on number of students who attend public vs. private school and the average cost of attending private school in that neighborhood.
* Ward with the highest (public or private) transportation costs.
* Ward residents with highest cost of healthcare, highest taxes, other factors that contribute to cost of living.

## Why this story is timely now (the 'so what'):

### Now that the COVID-19 moratorium on evictions had ended it will be interesting to see where Washingtonians can actually afford (or not afford) to live.

## People I could talk to as sources:

### 
* Members on the Washington, D.C. city Council
* The largest apartment buildings in each ward
* The most popular supermarkets, internet providers in each ward
* D.C. residents who live in each ward

## Anything else important:

### This data can of course change year to year so it would be important to get accurate and up-to-date information that would reflect the D.C. ward with the highest cost of living explicitly for fall 2021.

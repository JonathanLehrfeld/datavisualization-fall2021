# Jonathan Lehrfeld Assignment 1 - Final Class Project Pitch & Data Critique

# - Final Class Project Pitch - 

## Question to answer:

### Which Washington, D.C. ward has the highest cost of living?

## Data that might be available (to answer my question):

### 
* Information on average apartment rent / housing cost / additional housing fees in each neighborhood.
* Information on average utilities cost in each neighborhood.
* Information on average internet cost in each neighborhood.
* Information on average cost of supermarket trip / frequency of supermarket trips in each neighborhood.
* Information on number of students who attend public vs. private school and the average cost of attending private school in that neighborhood.
* Ward with the highest (public or private) transportation costs.
* Ward residents with highest cost of healthcare, highest taxes, other factors that contribute to cost of living.

## Why this story is timely now (the 'so what'):

### Now that the COVID-19 moratorium on evictions had ended it will be interesting to see where Washingtonians can actually afford (or not afford) to live.

## People I could talk to as sources:

### 
* Members on the Washington, D.C. city Council
* The largest apartment buildings in each ward
* The most popular supermarkets, internet providers in each ward
* D.C. residents who live in each ward

## Anything else important:

### This data can of course change year to year so it would be important to get accurate and up-to-date information that would reflect the D.C. ward with the highest cost of living explicitly for fall 2021.

## Clarity & Accuracy

### 
* Central insight = 3 / 5 
* I was not immediately aware of the central insight because the story opens with an anecdote that draws the reader in before explaining the core of the article, but a few graffs down I got there. The central insight was that in D.C. renters facing eviction often have a lot of rights, but it all rests on whether they are notified they need to come to court. The problem is however that in D.C. there are a limited number of "private process servers" who are hired by landlords to serve the eviction notices and two specific process servers who serve the majority of the region are lying (based on affadavits) about correctly serving these summons.
* No this central theme was not necessarily in the headline, instead the headline posed a quesiton that the article answered regarding whether or not Washingtonians know to show up to court.
* The only use of data visualization in this article was a short video clip of a Google Maps illustrating the number of homes the processor Stephens allegedly went to in his affadavit. 1/5
* I think in part this was an effective was to visualize the data, to prove how absurd the claims from the process server are and that he was not really doing his job correctly. That being said, it could likely be improved still by by making it more ...

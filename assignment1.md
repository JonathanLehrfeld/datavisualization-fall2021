# Jonathan Lehrfeld Assignment 1 - Final Class Project Pitch & Data Critique

# - Final Class Project Pitch - 

## Question to answer:

### Which Washington, D.C. ward has the highest cost of living?

## Data that might be available (to answer my question):

### 
* Information on average apartment rent / housing cost / additional housing fees in each neighborhood.
* Information on average utilities cost in each neighborhood.
* Information on average internet cost in each neighborhood.
* Information on average cost of supermarket trip / frequency of supermarket trips in each neighborhood.
* Information on number of students who attend public vs. private school and the average cost of attending private school in that neighborhood.
* Ward with the highest (public or private) transportation costs.
* Ward residents with highest cost of healthcare, highest taxes, other factors that contribute to cost of living.

## Why this story is timely now (the 'so what'):

### Now that the COVID-19 moratorium on evictions had ended it will be interesting to see where Washingtonians can actually afford (or not afford) to live.

## People I could talk to as sources:

### 
* Members on the Washington, D.C. city Council
* The largest apartment buildings in each ward
* The most popular supermarkets, internet providers in each ward
* D.C. residents who live in each ward

## Anything else important:

### This data can of course change year to year so it would be important to get accurate and up-to-date information that would reflect the D.C. ward with the highest cost of living explicitly for fall 2021.

# - Data Reporting Critique on [DCist article](https://dcist.com/story/20/10/05/thousands-of-d-c-renters-are-evicted-every-year-do-they-all-know-to-show-up-to-court/) -

## Clarity & Accuracy

### 
* Central insight = 3 / 5 
* I was not immediately aware of the central insight because the story opens with an anecdote that draws the reader in before explaining the core of the article, but a few graffs down I got there. The central insight was that in D.C. renters facing eviction often have a lot of rights, but it all rests on whether they are notified they need to come to court. The problem is however that in D.C. there are a limited number of "private process servers" who are hired by landlords to serve the eviction notices and two specific process servers who serve the majority of the region are lying (based on affadavits) about correctly serving these summons. The call to action is that D.C. needs to license and regulate process servers.
* No this central theme was not necessarily in the headline, instead the headline posed a quesiton that the article answered regarding whether or not Washingtonians know to show up to court.
* The only use of data visualization in this article was a short video clip of a Google Maps illustrating the number of homes the processor Stephens allegedly went to in his affadavit. 1/5
* I think in part this was an effective way to visualize the data, to prove how absurd the claims from the process server are and that he was not really doing his job correctly. That being said, in practice it could definitely be improved still by by making it more visually appealing, i.e. using more then just a clip art image of a house over Google Maps. Or the authors could have made a timeline graphic. There was also a lot of statistics in the article about the number of people who have been evicted in D.C. which could have been made better by using a visual element, but the authors did not include this.
* The accuracy of the data was likely high because of the legitimacy of the media outlet DCist.
* I questioned the accuracy of the data only at times when it said it referenced data from many years earlier, such as when it said the most recent number they could find on total convictions was in 2016 (at 4,500 evictions). Also at time when it said "studies indicate" and then hyperlinked to the study instead of just referencing it.
* I would recommend the reporter check in with private process servers in other states to see what their regulations are like and compare and contrast to D.C. I also think they could have done more to get the Superior Court to comment. They did source their information from sworn affadavits, a number of studies and othe legal experts.
* Everything that needed explaining was ...

## Quality

###
* Degree of quality = 1 / 5
* Again as mentioned previously I think the idea for the data visualization graphic in this piece was on point, but that its execution and quality were not at that same level. I liked the video element and the time clock usage to illustrate that Stephens could not have been in all of the places he claimed to have been during that day - but I think the authors could have put in a bit more effort than the basic video they created. The houses were not even on exact addresses, just vaguely in the area of where the journalists are trying to indicate Stephens went to serve summons. Other areas of improvement - I would have liked to see the following information put into a graphic (likely a bar chart): the number of eviction cases in D.C. every year, the number of annual eviction cases across the country per year, the reasons behind eviction cases in D.C., the number of cases where tenants lost their landlord-tenant hearing.

## Type & Color

### 
* The type and color looked like they belonged together. It was a very simple grey background and a black sans-serif font. It looked professional and serious but also directed towards a general audience.
* My eyes were first drawn to the photo at the topic. It is a cartoon image of a judge in a courtroom looking at the witness stand, but instead of someone sitting there it is a white outlined figure of a person (indicating the witness is not there) with a sign hanging on them saying "Eviction Notice".
* My rating for type would be 4 / 5. It is clear to read and a good size, and I like that it is sans-serif because it feels less overly proffessional and easy to read for a general audience. 
* My rating for color would be 3 / 5. It's not anything special, but also maybe making it plain makes the seriousness of the article stand out even more.

## Creativity

### 
* The creative elements were mostly the photos of the D.C. residents who had been served eviction notices. Seeing the actual people who were affected definitely helps bring the story to life. I think I would still rate it 3 / 5 because the story needed more the illustrate the compex numbers and financial amounts being referenced. I would have liked to see visualization of the data interwoven in, or a timeline that the audience can interact with (where they drag the time piece and see on a map where the process server supposedly went.

# Assignment 4
## Question 1 - A link to the data set I explored on Recycling Pickup Days in Washington, D.C. can be found [HERE](https://arcg.is/0zS80S0). The questions I asked before reviewing and analysing this data include
* Which days of the week do most district residents have their recycling picked up? 
* Do certain D.C. wards respectively have their recycling collected on certain days more than other days? 
* Is the average route of time to collect recycling longer on some days versus other days?
### After analyzing the data available I found that the day of the week recycling is picked up in the district is relatively balanced between Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays (with 24, 25, 25, and 22 respective pickups) but that significantly less recycling is picked up on Fridays (with only 16 pick-ups).
###  I also found that certain wards did have more common days their recycling was picked up than other days. For example, in ward 3 their recycling is exclusively picked up on Thursdays. In ward 5, recycling is picked up only on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. Also Fridays are almost exclusively the day that recycling is picked up in wards 7 and 8, and almost no other wards have Friday pick up days.
### Lastly, according to the data I observed, the average route of time to collect recycling did not appear to be longer on some days (or even in certain wards) versus others.
## Question 2 -  As we are reporting in D.C. I thought it would be important to find a data set that related to the area, so the first thing I did was go to the website Open Data DC. I then decided to explore whether the district had any public data on a more niche department, the department of Public Works and their recycling collection, and surprisingly they did! After typing in “recycle pickup days” I was able to pull up the data set I linked above in question one. The data set was first published on April 24, 2020 and was most recently updated on September 14 of this year. After downloading the data set as a CSV I did the following to clean the data:
* Create a separate sheet in the file to keep track of the original data as I downloaded it. Then copied and pasted over the data from the first sheet to the second so I could keep track of any changes I made.
* I then filtered the data in column D, Route_Day (i.e. recycling pick up day), to each day of the week (Monday, Tuesday, etc.). For each day of the week I did this I copied all of the data in sheet 2 and pasted it into sheet 3 so that the data was ordered in a descending way by day of the week. At the end, in sheet 3, I had all of the data again but this time more easily readable by recycling day (Monday, Tuesday, etc.)
* I copied all of the data again from sheet one and put it into sheet 2, this time filtering by each district ward number. I then copied all of the data each time I filtered it and put it into a fourth sheet in descending order. At the end, in sheet 4, I had all of the data more easily readable by the ward number in which the recycling occurred. It is worth noting however that only 87 of the 112 lines of data included the ward number where the recycling was taking place, so there is a chance some of my observations are not completely accurate - and so an article on this would require follow up with the Public Works office.
## Question 3 - Samle headline: D.C. Wards 7 and 8 can only almost only recycle on Fridays
* Fridays are the most common day for recycling to be collected in D.C. wards seven and eight according to data from the Open Data D.C. website. Only a handful of other pick-up routes in wards one and two have Fridays as their designated recycling day. 
* Most of the other six wards in D.C. have their recycling collected between Monday and Thursday.
* With less composting options in wards seven and eight compared to the rest of the district, recycling is one of the biggest sources of being a sustainable resident in the district. Since recycling however is only collected at the end of the week in these two wards, residents have grown frustrated with the need to constantly be home closer to the weekend to make sure their recycling gets out.

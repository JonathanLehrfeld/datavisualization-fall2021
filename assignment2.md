### What has not already been done, and that we have thought about potentially tackling - but would like Sean's input on

* How many individuals in D.C. who received traffic tickets eventually filed for bankruptcy over the unpaid fees?
* How many individuals who were ticketed have a disability or a medical condition?
* Is there a certain age group of individuals being targeted by D.C. traffic cameras?
* Aside from Black Washingtonians, what is the second largest racial minority being targeted by D.C. parking / traffic tickets?
* What other cities have implemented Vision Zero programs? How does that work compared to in D.C.?
* Does vision Zero only relate to car traffic deaths or could it relate to other modes of transportation as well? How many people are injured on the metro or via scooters in DC?
* Scooter accidents? Only the youths? Other demographics?
* What factors have complicated the Vision Zero project since it was 
* Is there a higher number of traffic cameras in predominantly Black DC neighborhoods? Less? Does that contribute to anything?
* Is the initial average ticket cost higher or lower or equal across DC?

### High quality data sets 
* [Data Set One](https://data.bts.gov/stories/s/Bikeshare-and-e-scooters-in-the-U-S-/fwcs-jprj/) This data set gives information on the influx of bike shares and e-scooters in the U.S. and includes data through June 2021. It explores trends in “micromobility” and has information by city / the name of the bike or scooter share and more. It is likely highly reliable as trustworthy source since it is from the U.S. Dept. of Transportation's Bureau of Labor Statistics. It also has a data visualization map (good inspiration for us)! Limitations to this data set include that even though it shows how many bikeshares and e-scooter systems there are it does not include information on how the proliferation of these transportation methods correlates with injuries / fatalities.  

* [Data Set Two](https://dcgis.maps.arcgis.com/apps/dashboards/a2f1cca5159e4c6eae197895d2e08336) This website has API data on several scooter brands. The District Department of Transportation requires them to file monthly reports that list how many rides were taken using the scooters as well as how many traffic incidents occurred. The information is being reported directly from the companies that own the scooters so they definitely have incentive to make the scooters seem as safe as possible to ensure they are allowed to keep scooters on the roads. Limitations could be that the department only collects data from 7 different dockless scooter companies and if they haven’t always collected this data, then it could be difficult to know their impact before this information was collected in this way. 

* [Data Set Three](https://dcgis.maps.arcgis.com/apps/dashboards/a2f1cca5159e4c6eae197895d2e08336) This data set is on Vision Zero Traffic Fatalities and Injury Crashes and is likely a very trustworthy source as it is from a combination of information from DC Police Department and Department of Transportation. It includes detailed information on the mode of traffic fatalities in Washington, D.C. - i.e. via bike, moped, etc. It also has the capacity of breaking down the traffic fatalities ward by ward. A limitation we noticed when going through this data set was that the data does not define what is a “major” or a “minor” non-fatal injury.

* [Data Set Four](https://www.dcvisionzero.com/maps-data) This is the data set from the actual D.C. Department of Transportation Vision Zero website, and thus is highly reliable and trustworthy in relation to understanding the Vision Zero project. Among other things, it provides the running total of traffic fatalities in D.C. and the number of crashes which involved an injury (plus the mode of the accident). It further provides demographic information that breaks the accidents down by the age of the victim and the ward in which it occurred. Limitations to this data are small, but one thing is that it only gives information back to 2018, even though the Vision Zero program started a few years prior.
